# 🎙️ Real-Time Voice AI Agent with LiveKit

This project demonstrates a **real-time voice AI agent** built on top of **LiveKit Agents**, integrating:
- **OpenAI** – LLM (GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini) for reasoning, Whisper for speech-to-text (STT)  
- **ElevenLabs** – Text-to-Speech (TTS) for natural human-like voice  
- **Silero VAD** – Voice Activity Detection for detecting speech boundaries  
- **LiveKit** – Real-time streaming backbone for low-latency communication  

The agent enables **natural two-way conversations**, where speech is streamed → transcribed → processed by LLM → converted back into speech, all in near real-time.
